# Spectroscopy-Analysis---Feature-Engineering-with-Analytical-Data
Data-driven modeling project on Spectroscopy datasets, FTIR, NMR, and GPC to develop a quantitative polymer structure-performance relationship -- Juliana Nam and Suhas Cristy Mathey

 ## Project Introduction
 The goal of this project is to create a computational workflow that takes in input analytical characterization data, for various materials of interest to Dow Chemical, and generates a quantitative polymer structure-performance relationship. The raw data provided by Dow Chemical included three forms of analytical characterization data obtained from NMR, FTIR, and GPC experiments for 12 material samples.
